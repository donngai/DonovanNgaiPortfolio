                    <h2>Hey, I'm Donovan Ngai</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a third year as a computer science student at Toronto Metropolitan University with over 4 years of programming experience. 
                        With a solid foundation in Java, Python, C, and more, I excel in creating innovative software solutions. 
                        My passion for technology is matched by my strong problem-solving skills, quick adaptability, and dedication to community service. 
                        Beyond academics, I thrive on collaborating with diverse groups and taking on leadership roles, particularly through my long-standing involvement with Scouts Canada. 
                        Let's connect and explore the exciting world of technology together!

                This is an inspiring quote, or a testimonial from a customer. 
                Maybe it's just filling up space, or maybe people will actually read it. 
                Who knows? All I know is that it looks nice.
